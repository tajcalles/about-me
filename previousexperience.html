       <p class='center-align prevexpptags'> I didn’t always know I
       wanted to do this. After 3 hard years of college pursuing a degree
       in Speech-Language Pathology, I wasn’t sure that it was actually
       something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. My first priority
       is being able to provide for my wife and future family, and I wasn’t
       confident that I would be doing that best being an SLP. My best
       friend referred me to Devpoint and introduced me to the field of
       web development, and it has been a breath of fresh air. I love to
       challenge myself. I know that in this field, while there is so much
       room for new people like me--there will always be something to learn.
       The dynamic nature of the industry is something that compels me to pursue
       a career in coding.</p>
       <p class='center-align prevexpptags'>That being said,
       the extent of my experience in web development is limited to the
       pre-course work I’ve been assigned. I’m very new to this, and I know this
       will be a difficult undertaking to learn all that I need to in order to
       make a career out of this. Be that as it may, working hard is something
      that I’m willing to do!</p>
