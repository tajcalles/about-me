      <p class='center-align p-tags'>The last 3 years of my life have been spent at Brigham Young University,
        where I was studying to be a speech-language pathologist. That being said,
        the extent of my experience in web development is limited to the
        pre-course work I’ve been assigned. I’m very new to this, and I know this
        will be a difficult undertaking to learn all that I need to in order to
        make a career out of this. Be that as it may, working hard is something
         that I’m willing to do! I’ve loved all the drills, work, and assignments
         that I’ve been assigned so far, and I can’t wait to learn all that
         Devpoint has to offer.</p>
