            <p class='center-align flex-end indexptags'>Welcome to my site! I hope that this, my first project, will help you to get to know me better. I am so excited to start learning how to code.</p>
            <p class='center-align flex-end indexptags'> I didn’t always know I wanted to do this. After 3 hard years of college pursuing a degree in Speech-Language Pathology, I wasn’t sure that it was actually something I wanted to do for the rest of my life. My first priority is being able to provide for my wife and future family, and I wasn’t confident that I would be doing that best being an SLP. My best friend referred me to Devpoint and introduced me to the field of web development, and it has been a breath of fresh air. I love to challenge myself. I know that in this field, while there is so much room for new people like me--there will always be something to learn. The dynamic nature of the industry is something that compels me to pursue a career in coding.</p>
