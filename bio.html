            <h1 class='center-align'>About Me</h1>
            <p class='center-align boutmeptags'>I was born in Provo, UT on August 6th, 1991.
              My family is from Hawai'i, but I grew up in Provo and Sandy here in Utah.
               I’ve always liked working with computers and building them, but never
               actually done a ton of work in programming. The last 3 years of my life
                were spent at Brigham Young University, where I was going to school to
                 be a speech language pathologist. This last year, I’ve wanted to make
                 a change in my life—hence, here I am at Devpoint Labs!In my spare time,
                 I love to play volleyball, video games, and cook. I’ve been around the sport
                 of volleyball for my entire life, and I started playing competitively when I was 15.
                 It’s great exercise to say the least, and it’s been a fun way for me to meet
              new people and travel to different places I would have never gone without
              the sport.</p>
            <p class='center-align boutmeptags'>Video games are a passion of mine as well.
                I usually play big name titles on PC (Overwatch, Starcraft 2, PUBG),
                but every now and then I play rhythm games like Guitar Hero and DDR.
                I love being engaged in something that I can control my fate in. Video
                games allow me to do that, and they provide me with feedback (via the
                score) to let me know whether I am succeeding or failing. I find that
                life sometimes isn’t black and white. There isn’t a concrete, definite
                score. At times, you need to think and decide for yourself whether or
                not you’re doing the right things for you (or not). Playing games on
                my PC allows me to skip the gray area and escape to something I can
                control, but doesn’t have lifelong-implications.</p>
            <p class='center-align boutmeptags'>Cooking is also a pastime of mine. I’m
                  not a pro chef, but I’ve worked many food jobs in my life--and actually
                  liked them! My favorite job in the foodservice industry was in Alaska.
                  I was a chef on a train called the Wilderness Express. Me and another
                  chef cooked breakfast, lunch, and dinner for tour guests. The work
                  combined with the beautiful scenery of Alaska made for an experience
                  I will never forget.</p>
