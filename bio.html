            <h1 class='center-align'>About Me</h1>
              <p class='center-align boutmeptags'>I was born in Provo, UT on August 6th, 1991.
                My family is from Hawai'i, but I grew up in Provo and Sandy here in Utah.
               I’ve always liked working with computers and building them, but never
               actually done a ton of work in programming. The last 3 years of my life
                were spent at Brigham Young University, where I was going to school to
                 be a speech language pathologist. This last year, I’ve wanted to make
                 a change in my life—hence, here I am at Devpoint Labs!In my spare time,
                 I love to play volleyball, video games, and cook. I’ve been around the sport
                 of volleyball for my entire life, and I started playing competitively when I was 15.
                 It’s great exercise to say the least, and it’s been a fun way for me to meet
                new people and travel to different places I would have never gone without
                the sport.</p>
                <p class='center-align boutmeptags'>Cooking is also a pastime of mine. I’m
                  not a pro chef, but I’ve worked many food jobs in my life--and actually
                  liked them! My favorite job in the foodservice industry was in Alaska.
                  I was a chef on a train called the Wilderness Express. Me and another
                  chef cooked breakfast, lunch, and dinner for tour guests. The work
                  combined with the beautiful scenery of Alaska made for an experience
                  I will never forget.</p>
