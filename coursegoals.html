      <p class='center-align p-tags'>I’ve always had a constant desire to be learning all the time. I feel that complacency, as well as pride, can hold a good person back from being great. In order to reach my full potential, as well as help others reach theirs, I always have a goal to be humble.</p>
      <p class='center-align p-tags'>I also want to work hard and meet new people. My friend Alex had a blast at Devpoint. While he did say that it was possibly the hardest thing he’d ever done, he loved his experience in coding school. He has contacts and friends that he met there that help him everyday. This is something I hope to obtain as well: a quality education, and friends that will always be there to help each other out, even long after school. Whether it be with questions or helpful tips shared in the Slack general channel, I hope to always be learning from my cohorts.</p>
